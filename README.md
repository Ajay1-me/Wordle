# Project 2 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Ajaydeep Singh**

**Wordle** is an app where players guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback on the correctness of guessed letters and their positions, challenging players to deduce the word through a process of elimination and word logic. The player can adjust the level of difficulty by changing the Number of Guesses, Number of Letters, Word Theme, etc. 

Time spent: **2.5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I faced problem figuring out the code for the first exercise. The exercises following the first were less challenging because they all were similar. 
- Implementing the optional feature was confusing because of the unfamiliarity with the Swift syntax.
